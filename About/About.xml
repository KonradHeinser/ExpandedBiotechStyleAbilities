This mod requires the EBSG framework for the abiltity comps and the think tree stuff. If you want your colonists to automatically cast certain abiltities, you will need to go to the EBSG Framework mod menu to enable them individually. Please remember that the check marks next to the mod names in that list are not for toggling all the options, but for hiding that mod from the list temporarily.

This mod seeks to make the genetic abilities list feel a little more robust than what vanilla has to offer, because normally you only have 8 ability options if you want to include bloodfeeder, which I usually don't. Unlike the other mods in the Biotech Style series ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]MBSG[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3020821838]EBSG[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039936922]EAG[/url]), I'm not planning on turning the vanilla abilities into a range from minor to hyper, because unlike most genes, there isn't much reason to have that kind of variance. Instead, this mod will be adding new types of abilities, from the unoriginal fire spray and acid spew to the almost original idea of Hemometallize (hemogen to steel conversion). At the moment this adds 23 new genes, 3 of which are for hemogenic pawns.

This mod does not have any CE patch. If someone would like one, please contact the CE devs through whatever channels they have set up for requesting CE patches.
