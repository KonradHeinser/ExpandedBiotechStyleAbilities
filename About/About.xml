This mod requires the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112549163]EBSG Framework[/url] for the ability comps and the think tree stuff. If you want your colonists to automatically cast certain abilities, you will need to go to the EBSG Framework mod menu to enable them individually. Please remember that the check marks next to the mod names in that list are not for toggling all the options, but for hiding that mod from the list temporarily.

If you aren't seeing Bloody Eclipse, Pacifying Needles, or Siren Call, make sure you have ignore restrictions set to true at the bottom right of the menu.

This mod seeks to make the genetic abilities list feel a little more robust than what vanilla has to offer, because normally you only have 8 ability options if you want to include bloodfeeder, which I usually don't. Unlike the other mods in the Biotech Style series ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]MBSG[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3020821838]EBSG[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039936922]EAG[/url]), I'm not planning on turning the vanilla abilities into a range from minor to hyper, because unlike most genes, there isn't much reason to have that kind of variance. Instead, this mod will be adding new types of abilities, from the unoriginal fire spray and acid spew to the almost original idea of Hemometallize (hemogen to steel conversion). 

At the moment this adds 21 new abilities (including blood spew's hemogen variant), 4 of which are for hemogenic pawns (including that variant). Three of the abilities are from archite genes, so if some appear to be missing, make sure you have ignore restrictions active.
